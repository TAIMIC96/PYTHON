## 📂 File Management & Data Parsing in Python

Working with files often involves structuring their contents to meet your needs. One key concept in this process is **parsing**—the process of converting data into a more readable or usable format.

### Why Parsing is Important:
- Certain parts of your Python code may need data in a specific format.
- Parsing enables Python to process data effectively.
- Programmers need to interpret results easily; parsing improves readability.

### 🛠️ Useful Python Methods for Parsing:
- `.split()`: Splits a string into a list.
- `.join()`: Joins elements of a list into a single string.
